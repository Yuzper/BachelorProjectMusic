Look into VPN for access cluster at home
If you can access http://hpc.itu.dk/ you have internet access.

ssh jete@hpc.itu.dk

make folder for project
git clone repository


squeue (s stands for slur)

scancel, will cancel a job

Copy file from local computer to cluster
scp [Source] [Target]
    Ex: scp [File] jete@hpc.itu.dk:/home/jete/...
Target = jete@hpc.itu.dk:./filename

You can check the status of the nodes of the "brown" partition with the following command:
sinfo -Nl -p brown

Notes Group Meeting:

Baseline fellow students, give the knowledge to understand the thesis.

Explain it is valid since it is not covered in related work or partly covered.

Do analysis/approach first, lastly the basics, intro etc.

Method, features, model, training etc.

Evaluation chapter, 

Conclusion, what is my contribution / what I learned in the process.

Related Work:
Different paramides / family of methods will have different subsections.

Have a brief section at the beginning of the section and details later in the section.
Okay to steal a figure if it is referenced.

Not as much explaination on CNN and RNN.
Explain the combined approach in CRNN.

-------------------------------------------------------
Questions 2:
 - Feedback on new report structure
Some defining metric for when I am done, qualitative/quantitative metric.


 - Some of the genres have multiple genres, I can either:
   - Have the same song entry for each genre
   - Choose randomly / choose first genre for each song
   - Discard these entries.

 - Ask about quotation problem in Latex


Look at the other papers from the same authors to authenticate their credability.

------------------------------------------------------
TO DO:
 - Python Enviroment setups
    - Upload data (After pre-processing)
    - Configure to use GPU and allocate appropriate resources
 - Implement the new CRNN model

 - Latex Problems:
    - Show last page
 - Cluster CRNN and BERT models

------------------------------------------------------
Sparring Section on Experiments:

Tensorboard
 - Compare if feature extract was better


Look at bachelor thesis on object tracking, analysis and evaluation section
Look at other bachelor thesis, using box diagram with whiskers to show the average performance for a specific hyperparameter.


19/4 2023: Hyperparameter lecture AML

------------------------------------------------------
In related work more on how it works, 

Idea
Details how the idea works
pros and cons of idea

explain metrics later on accuracy vs f1-score

------------------------------------------------------
Argumentations:
Half tone pitch shifting
One tone pitch shifting
Time overlap
Noise injection
Each combination (Tone pitch either or)

CRNN Analysis:
 - Time step, what prediction at each timestep
 - Apply the CNN filters it learns on some images to visually see what it learns.



Look into CRNN in the music field
Use based on or hyperparameter search,
Make a random state static, in the training and testing
tf.setseed

Maybe do a second hyperparameter search after doing augmentations due to extra data, figure out if a specific hyperparameter improve 

Salensymap

Genre graph baseline compare with spectogram compare with augmented graph.


(Similar audio analysis) Iris Weiser, Stefan Heinrich website


Accuracy is fine metric but F1-score will still tell me if there
are some problems with individual class predictions.

 - Early stopping with validation set
 - Loss over time graph
 - Test set activation over time
 - Big plot with x-axis AUC curve for genre y-axis is different augmentations.
 - Where and how does the augmentation improve?
