TODO:
 - Hyperparameter/Train augmented models
 - Analysis on average or best models of each type
 - Write report



No augmented data in testing

3 Levels of optimization:
- Hyperparameter for baseline, artectecture etc
- Individual argemntations and play with different values for those
     - Log scale space between values (Only the most relevant values, based on paper)
- Combinations of the different values and test which are best.

- Everything after this will be done analysis on
-
